What the project does
This app is a version of a classic memory game created with React. It renders different images to the screen which listen for click events. 
Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page should shuffle themselves in a random order.
It keeps track of the user's score which is incremented when clicking an image for the first time. 
The score resets to 0 if the user clicks the same image more than once.
Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game should restart.
